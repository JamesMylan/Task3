# Vector Calculator
By James Mylan
## Project Description
This program allows for the addition of up to six 2-dimensional vectors, entered in eithier x-y coordinate form or magnitude-angle form. It calculates the resultant vector and displays it algebraically, as well as displaying a graphical representation on the Cartesian plane. This application can be used as a tool in solving problems involving vectors from fields such as Mathematics and Physics. The program is codede in Python and utilises the Pygame and Pygame-GUI libraries.
